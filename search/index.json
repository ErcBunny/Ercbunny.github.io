[{"content":"WIP\nI have 5+ years of experience designing, coding, and simulating autonomous micro aerial vehicles. During my study and research, I developed a great interest in perception-related tasks and algorithms, as well as data-driven and learning-based methods of solving practical problems. Now, my main interests are 3D vision/SLAM/VIO, ML/AI, and image/video processing.
