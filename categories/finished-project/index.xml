      <description>VIDEO DEMO    OVERVIEW  We were required to program QKM manipulators to play Jenga automatically My part was doing hand-eye calibration, blob analysis, path/trajectory planning and simple UI The robot operates like this:  Take a picture with camera and calculate target positions Do path and trajectory planning Upload planned trajectory to bot Run     HAND-EYE CALIBRATION HEC Explained in A Nutshell  Aims to find the transform matrix from camera frame to tool frame.</description>

      <description>VIDEO DEMO    PROJECT OVERVIEW   Nothing interesting or related to cutting-edge research. Just an engineering level practice
  Some technical approaches:
 Localization: optical flow, TOF sensor Detection and navigation: YOLO + KCF + Hough Circle Transform on TX2 Flight controller: ACFLY ADRC Communication between FC and TX2: velocity command through serial UART     DETAILED REPORT   View Control and Electronic Circuit Design Scheme PDF (Chinese)</description>

      <title>A 3-Rotor VTOL UAV</title>

      <description>VIDEO DEMO    SYSTEM OVERVIEW   VTOL is achieved by adding a mixing unit to the F4 flight controller running Betaflight Y3 firmware
  The mixing unit takes in PWM outputs of a basic multicopter flight controller and yields signals for VTOL actuators
  We only implemented attitude control. Communication between boards is via PWM
